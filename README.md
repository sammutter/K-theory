# K-theory
Algorithms employed in my thesis and the paper "C*-algebras of higher-rank graphs..."
These were not designed for the public eye! They are therefore messy and poorly commented.
To get some more detail about what they are used for, read my thesis: "New models of higher-rank graphs..."

3D_dominoes.py takes lists of tiles (themselves lists of length 4) and configures them into 3D-dominoes.
It outputs the list of cubes, as well as the relevant short exact sequence of Evans as MAGMA-readable code.
